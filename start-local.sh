# This script automates the startup of the local development environment for the
# AI-Powered Observability Demo Generator on macOS.
#
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Sets up and starts the Python/FastAPI backend in the background.
# 2. Sets up and starts the Node.js/React frontend in the foreground.
# 3. Sets up a trap to automatically shut down the backend when you stop the script (Ctrl+C).
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Node.js and npm
# - Python 3.9+ and pip
